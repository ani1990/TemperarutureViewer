1) Reading temperature of panStamp nodes using SI7021 temperature and humidity sensor. 
2) Developing an Android application to display real-time temperature data.
3) Firebase cloud database is used to store data from panStamp nodes, which ultimately read by Android application in real-time    to plot real-time graph.  
4) Comparison of sesitivity between SI7021 and DHT11 external temperature sensor using Arduino UNO.
